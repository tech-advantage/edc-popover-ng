        <article class="article-content"><h3>Why use simple language?</h3>

<p>Technical writing must be clear, consistent and concise. The goal of concise writing is to use the most effective words. Concise writing does not always have the fewest words, but it always has the strongest ones. When only the most effective words remain, writing is far more concise and readable.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the average reading proficiency level is about 9th grade. Do not be afraid to use vocabulary that feels too simple at first glance.</p>

<p>The following rules are from the edc style guide and are given for information purposes. You are encouraged to create your own style guide, tailored to your user's needs.</p>

<p>The rules are formatted that way because I've been rereading Good Omens again and I'm taking you all down with me.</p>

        <article class="article-content"><h4>Thou shalt replace Vague Words with Specific Ones.</h4>

<p>Vague words are confusing and make sentences needlessly long. A dictionary of synonyms is your friend. For example:</p>

<p>"In orders to signal that you want to create a new folder, click on the desktop&nbsp;with the third mouse button.”</p>

<p>can be written:</p>

<p>"Right-click on the desktop &gt; New &gt; New folder."</p>

<p>Yes, this is exaggerated, but not by much.</p>
</article>
        <article class="article-content"><h4>Thou shalt Keep It Short</h4>

<h5>Sentence and paragraph length</h5>

<p>A paragraph collects related sentences dealing with a single topic. If you begin to transition to a new idea, add a new paragraph. A sentence likewise needs to express one single idea.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>“My grandmother lives in the woods where there are wolves.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>has two ideas. Instead, we should write:</p>

<p>“My grandmother lives in the woods. There are wolves there.”</p>

<p>Ideally, a sentence should be between seven and ten words long. A paragraph should be no longer than seven to ten sentences.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h5>Redundancies</h5>

<p>Every word needs to add something important and unique to a sentence. Every sentence needs to add something important and unique to the document. Trim redundancies mercilessly.</p>

<p>Note: your shortened sentences still need to be full, grammatically-correct, actual sentences.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Close proximity =&gt; proximity</li>
	<li>End result =&gt; result</li>
	<li>In the event that =&gt; if</li>
	<li>Summarize briefly =&gt; summarize</li>
	<li>CPU Unit =&gt; CPU.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h5>Intensifiers</h5>

<p>Avoid using terms such as "really", "very", "quite", "extremely", "severely" when they are not necessary.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h5>Prepositional Phrases</h5>

<p>Try to avoid using too many prepositional phrases in a single sentence. They can obscure the main subject and action of the sentence.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>"It is a matter of the gravest possible importance to the stability of the application and its various plugins that all developers, be they internal or subcontractors, respect the procedures established by the members of the integration team.".</p>

<p>can be written:</p>

<p>"All developers must follow the integration pipeline to avoid bugs."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h5>Terms to avoid</h5>

<p>Some words do not add any value to technical documentation. They are either not clear enough, or useless.</p>

<p>Use sparingly:</p>

<ul>
	<li>enable&nbsp;</li>
	<li>allow.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Avoid:</p>

<ul>
	<li>please&nbsp;</li>
	<li>welcome&nbsp;</li>
	<li>easy/hard/advanced (too subjective)&nbsp;</li>
	<li>desired.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Never:</p>

<ul>
	<li>simply.</li>
</ul>

<p>Users usually read the help when they’re already stuck on a task. They are probably not in a very good mood. Telling them that the task they’re trying to perform is actually simple is a good way to get them to throw their computer at your head.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h5>Modals</h5>

<p>Whenever possible, do not use these modals:</p>

<ul>
	<li>may, might&nbsp;</li>
	<li>could&nbsp;</li>
	<li>should&nbsp;</li>
	<li>would&nbsp;</li>
	<li>will.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>They can confuse users. They are obstacles to a clear and unambiguous documentation.</p>

</article>
        <article class="article-content"><h4>Thou shalt be Careful with Conditions</h4>

<h5>Conditions first</h5>

<p>If you put a condition in a sentence, write it at the beginning.</p>

<p>Do not write "Click the Update button if you want to update your software.".</p>

<p>Write "To update your software, click the Update button.".</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h5>Bye Bye By</h5>

<p>Whenever possible, avoid "by + ing".</p>

<p>Do not write " You can reduce the risk of attacks by configuring the default website.".</p>

<p>Write "To reduce the risk of attacks, configure the default website.".</p>

<p>If the song is now stuck in your head: you're welcome.</p>
</article>
        <article class="article-content"><h4>Thou shalt use the Active Voice</h4>

<p>In a sentence written in the active voice, the subject of the sentence acts. In a sentence written in the passive voice, the subject receives the action. Whenever possible, use the active voice and avoid the passive voice.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the new data is added in the data tree =&gt; the new data appears in the data tree</li>
	<li>the option can be found under Processing &gt; Sproing =&gt; to access the options, go to Processing &gt; Sproing.</li>
</ul>
</article>
        <article class="article-content"><h4>Thou shalt use the Present Tense</h4>

<p>Always use present indicative or imperative to write technical documentation.</p>

<p>Avoid:</p>

<ul>
	<li>present perfect&nbsp;</li>
	<li>future.</li>
</ul>
</article>
        <article class="article-content"><h4>Thou shalt use Proper Punctuation</h4>

<ul>
	<li>At the risk of stating the obvious, a sentence starts with a capitalized word and ends with a period.</li>
	<li>Use hyphens to link names: "Five-year plan", "Two-year old".</li>
	<li>Never use hyphens after adverbs: "Badly designed project".</li>
	<li>Do not use ";" or "&amp;".</li>
	<li>Do not use "etc.". Use "…".</li>
	<li>In English, there is never a space between a word and punctuation marks: "What is it?" / "there are three steps:".</li>
</ul>
