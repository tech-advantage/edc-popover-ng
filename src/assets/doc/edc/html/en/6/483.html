        <article class="article-content"><p><strong><em>Documentation types</em></strong> cater to different information requirements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By defult,<em><strong> edc </strong></em>proposes:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Contextualised UI Help</strong>: the basic building block of contextualised help</li>
	<li><strong>How To</strong>: short procedures for accomplishing tasks</li>
	<li><strong>Concepts</strong>: definitions and explanations about concepts</li>
	<li><strong>Training</strong>: step-by-step instructions for learning to use your software</li>
	<li><strong>Q&amp;A</strong>: anticipate user questions,&nbsp;can be qualified as FAQ later</li>
	<li><strong>Glossary:</strong>&nbsp;short definitions of unfamiliar terms.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can&nbsp;define your own <strong><em>Documentation types, </em></strong>in&nbsp;<strong>Configuration &gt; Content management &gt; Strategies.</strong></p>

<p>If necessary, you can also give your documentation type&nbsp;an alias.</p>

        <article class="article-content"><h3>Contextualised UI help</h3>

<p>This is a map&nbsp;of the product UI bricks.</p>

<p>Usually, the map is provided by a developer. Writers can also build the brick map.</p>

<p>Content for contextualised help should be&nbsp;brief. Keep the end-product in mind: the user help appears in the software.</p>
</article>
        <article class="article-content"><h3>How tos&nbsp;</h3>

<p>These are simple steps for using a part of the product and carrying out one simple task.</p>

<p>Steps are grouped into larger procedures that make sense in terms of what the user wants to do, not only based on feature know-how.</p>
</article>
        <article class="article-content"><h3>Concepts</h3>

<p>A concept is used to explain abstract information about your product. Concepts can be grouped into themes.</p>

<p>Background information can be used where necessary&nbsp;without saturating the user. For example, they may simply need to be reminded how to carry out a task without procedures.</p>
</article>
        <article class="article-content"><h3>Training</h3>

<p>Design these as short explanations with real data that can be read by the user in-site&nbsp;or offline.</p>

<p>One specific use is gettings users up and running.</p>

<p>Writing for this type of information requires an understanding of user personas and how to write for these personas.</p>
</article>
        <article class="article-content"><h3>Questions and answers</h3>

<p>Forget the&nbsp;notion of FAQ. Questions have answers. Analytics will determine if they are frequently read.</p>
</article>
        <article class="article-content"><h3>Glossary</h3>

<p>Use this to explain unfamiliar terms to your users. The definition appears as a pop-up.</p>
