<p>Contextualised user help is accessible directly from an interface. It is the point of entry for your users.</p>

<p>The key concept in designing contextualized UI brick help is <strong>context</strong>.&nbsp;Users always work within&nbsp;a&nbsp;particular context. The context dictates the kind of help they need. When writing contextualized help, always keep&nbsp;the user experience in mind. While this may seem applicable to all help content, this mindset is especially important when writing contextualized help. If you don't take your user's context into account, the user help is almost guaranteed to be useless.</p>

<p>Always try to write for the most typical user of the interface in question.&nbsp;</p>

        <article class="article-content"><h3>Defining the user and her context</h3>

<p>In order to write for your most typical user, you need to know who that user is. Using personas is useful, but without going this far, you can always create a checklist of questions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>is my user using the documented window at home or at work?</li>
	<li>how old are they? A 70-year-old is likely to have a very different relationship with software than a 10-year-old</li>
	<li>what do they want to accomplish when opening the documented window?</li>
	<li>why&nbsp;would they need to open the user help? are they beginner users? are they not very computer-literate? did they just forget how the window works?</li>
	<li>how much patience do they have left? usually, users open the user help when they're stuck on something they've been trying to solve on their own for a while, so they're probably at least slightly aggravated already. This is why it's important to keep your content short and to the point.&nbsp;Contextualized help is not about giving the users everything they must know, but rather giving them what they need at that precise moment and no more.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Answering these questions may be complex if you don't have direct access to users. Communicating with customer support or your marketing team&nbsp;can be helpful here.</p>

        <article class="article-content"><h3>Contextual content</h3>

<p>It should be very brief and to the point. For additional information,&nbsp;add links to pertinent documents of other types: how-tos, concepts, training, etc. You can order these links to&nbsp;stage&nbsp;the reading experience.</p>

<p>Depending on context, the help can be as simple as "Click here to publish.", or it could provide steps to publishing, or it can mention&nbsp;the result of taking an action, such as "When you click publish, you'll get a .zip file".</p>

<p>UI help is made up of six possible article types. In most cases, you only need one. Restricting yourself&nbsp;forces you to think of the type of content which is the most pertinent. If you end up wanting to use all six types, there may be something wrong with the interface itself (poor usability, unclear terminology, etc.). Talk&nbsp;to developers about where the documentation access is made available, or about the ergonomics and clarity of the UI.</p>
