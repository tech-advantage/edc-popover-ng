<p>When creating a brick, you can upload a reference image. This lets&nbsp;the writer start working even if they can't access the windows to be documented. It is also a useful reference to see if the interface changed since the user help was first created.</p>

<p>To upload a reference image to a UI help brick, go to the Parameters tab. A Reference Image section is available.</p>

<p><img src="505/41.png" style="height:259px; width:600px" /></p>

<p>There are three options to upload a reference image:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Upload.</strong></li>
	<li>Double-click in&nbsp;the upload field.</li>
	<li>Drag and drop the image directly into the upload field.</li>
</ul>
